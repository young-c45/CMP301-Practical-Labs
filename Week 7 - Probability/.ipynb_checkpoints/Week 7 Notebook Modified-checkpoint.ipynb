Both bags look identical from the outside and one is on the table in front of you. Although you aren't sure which it is, you have some reason to think that it is bag $A$ so you assign a prior probability of 0.7 to $A$. An experiment is set up as follows. You are allowed to take one ball at random from the bag (without looking inside) and observe whether it is white or red. When you do this, you observe a white ball. Use Bayes' theorem to determine the probability that the bag is $A$ and the probability that it is $B$ given this observation.\n",

This probability is $P(W|A) = 0.5$. (Clearly, if $R$ represents observing a red ball, then $P(R|A) = 0.5$.) Similarly, we know that $P(W|B) = 0.9$. (Clearly, $P(R|B) = 0.1$.) We can now use the law of total probability to work out $P(W)$ and then Bayes' theorem to work out the probability that the bag is $A$ given that we have observed white, i.e. $P(A|W)$.

    "After observing the white ball in exercise 3, the ball is then returned to the bag. Another ball is withdrawn randomly. It also is observed to be white and then returned to the bag. Then for a third and final time, a ball is withdrawn randomly and again it is observed to be white. Use Bayes' theorem to obtain the probability that the bag is $A$ and the probability that it is $B$ after all three observations.\n",

Then we start the process again to update the probabilities for $A$ and $B$ based on the second observation of a white ball. These then become our prior probabilities and we repeat the process once more."
