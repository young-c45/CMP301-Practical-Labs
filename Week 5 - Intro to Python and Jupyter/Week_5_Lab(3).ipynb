    "## Plotting data using Matplotlib\n",
    "<a href=\"https://matplotlib.org/\">Matplotlib</a> is a very useful library for producing figures in Python. (We will also come across another plotting library called *Seaborn* which is based on Matplotlib.) Here we will use the *Pyplot* interface within Matplotlib. For further details, see https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-introductory-pyplot-py You should look at these resources to explore more details about how to plot and edit figures.\n",
